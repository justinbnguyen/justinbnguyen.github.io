    summary: |
      Hi! I am a second-year master's student studying biostatistics at UTHealth Houston and a [research assistant](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~akorkut/#/home) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. My primary research mentor is [Dr. Anil Korkut](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/anil_korkut.html) of the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Along with Dr. Korkut, postdoc [Dr. Elisa Kong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisa-kong-74a04a280/) also mentors me as I have been working with her on TP53-mutated and -wildtype cancers in support of the TP53 Moon Shot group. 
    
      Initially, I completed my bachelor's in kinesiology with the idea of becoming a clinician. Upon realizing my strong interests in the quantiative side of basic science research, I pivoted to biostatistics. My interests in applying biostatistical methods to research have only intesnified. I aim to pursue a doctorate in biostatistics following my master's.
