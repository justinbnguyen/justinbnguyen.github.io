    summary: |
      Hi! I am a second-year master's student studying biostatistics at UTHealth Houston and a [research assistant](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~akorkut/#/home) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. My primary research mentor is [Dr. Anil Korkut](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/anil_korkut.html) from the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Currently, I am working with Dr. Korkut on my master's thesis to explore cellular interactions within tumors through spatial geonomic image analysis. 
    
      Initially, I completed my bachelor's in kinesiology with the idea of becoming a clinician. Upon realizing my strong interests in the quantitative side of basic science research, I pivoted to biostatistics. My interests in applying biostatistical methods, specifically to cancer genomics, have since only intensified. I aim to pursue a doctorate in biostatistics following my master's.
